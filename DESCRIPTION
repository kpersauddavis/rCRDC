The CRDC APIs offer access to two separate datasets: Public School Enrollment in 2013-14 and Out-of-School Suspensions in 2013-2014. The package provides a set of functions for making both small and large batch query requests from the CRDC APIs. The package also provides a function for merging the two available datasets. All functions in the package return a R readable object for analysis and also provide the optionallity to preproccess the data.
